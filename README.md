# GeoReVi

<img align="right" src="docs/Icon.png" width="50px">
GeoReVi (Geological Reservoir Virtualization) is an open-source data management and analysis tool for subsurface applications. The software is intended to be used for reservoir data collection, data processing, data curation, data visualization and eventually for reservoir characterization. Data is stored in a local or server database dependent on the specific needs. The software runs on all Windows systems.

## Getting started
To get started with GeoReVi you have to download the packed file [GeoReVi.zip](https://github.com/ApirsAL/GeoReVi/blob/master/binaries/GeoReVi.zip) in the **binaries** folder, unpack it and run the installation file (GeoReVi.exe). Tutorials can be found in the user manual. Exemplary datasets and samples are provided in the **docs** folders and in the zip archive. To setup a multi-user-environment you have to change the section including the connection string in your GeoReVi.exe.config file in the installation folder to the according database. However, then a properly structured database with many stored procedures is needed. Contact us under contact@georevi.com for more information.
