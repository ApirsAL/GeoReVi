# GeoReVi
GeoReVi (Geological Reservoir Virtualization) is an open-source data management and analysis tool for subsurface applications. The software is intended to be used for reservoir data collection, data processing, data curation, data visualization and eventually for reservoir characterization. Data is stored in a local or server database dependent on the specific needs. The software runs on all Windows systems.

## License

This project is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 License - see the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file for details

The LOCAL ONLY version of the software is freely available. To setup a multi-user-environment you have to change the section including the connection string in your GeoReVi.config.xml file in the installation folder to the according database. However, you need a properly structured database with many stored procedures. Concact us under contact@georevi.com for more information.

## Getting started
To get started with GeoReVi you have to download the installer file (GeoReVi.exe) in the docs folder and run the installation. Tutorials can be found in the user manual. Exemplary datasets and samples are provided in the docs folders.


## Contributing
Individual view-models and views can be developed and integrated into GeoReVi.

If bugs or any other issues are identified we would be grateful for reporting those in the [Issues](https://github.com/ApirsAL/GeoReVi/issues).
