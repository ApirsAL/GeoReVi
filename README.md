# GeoReVi

<img align="right" src="docs/Icon.png" width="50px">
GeoReVi (Geological Reservoir Virtualization) is an open-source data management and analysis tool for subsurface characterization. Data is stored in a local or server database dependent on the specific needs. The software runs on all Windows systems.

## License

The *local* version of the software is freely available.

## Requirements
OS: Microsoft Windows

## Built With
* [Windows Presentation Foundation](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/dotnet/framework/wpf/) - Main application framework
* [Entity framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/ef/) - The database framework used
* [HelixToolkit](https://github.com/helix-toolkit/helix-toolkit}{HelixToolkit.WPF) - 3D visualization
* [Managed Extensibility Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/dotnet/framework/mef/) - Modular development
* [Accord.NET](http://accord-framework.net) - Linear Algebra and Machine Learning helper
* [Caliburn.Micro](https://caliburnmicro.com/) - Awesome MVVM development framework
* [FontAwesomeWPF](https://github.com/charri/Font-Awesome-WPF/) - Icon provider
* [LiteDB](https://www.litedb.org/) - Embedded NoSQL database
* [GeoAPI](https://github.com/NetTopologySuite/GeoAPI) - Coordinate conversion and projection framework
* [MoreLinq](https://morelinq.github.io) - Helpful Query Framework
* [Extended WPF Toolkitâ„¢](https://github.com/xceedsoftware/wpftoolkit) - Providing nice UI controls like the AvalonDock
* [Math.NET](https://www.mathdotnet.com/) - Math magic
* [Alglib](https://www.alglib.net/) - Solving sparse systems of linear equations


## Getting started
To get started with GeoReVi you have to download the executable file [GeoReViv1.0.1.exe](https://github.com/ApirsAL/GeoReVi/blob/master/binaries/GeoReViv1.0.1.exe) in the **binaries** folder and run the installation. Tutorials can be found in the user manual. Exemplary datasets and samples are provided in the **docs** folders and in the zip archive. To setup a multi-user-environment you have to change the section including the connection string in your GeoReVi.exe.config file in the installation folder to the according database. However, then a properly structured database with many stored procedures is needed. Contact us under contact@georevi.com for more information.

## The Scope
* Multi-tiered, extendable software application that aims to support geoscientists in common workflows during subsurface characterization
* Geoscientific data management and analysis including petrophysical, geochemical, hydraulic, granulometric, magnetic, mechanical, sedimentary, elastic and radiogenic properties eased by a graphical user interface
* Providing a rich selection of data mining algorithms and visualization techniques specifically aimed to characterize subsurface regions
