# GeoReVi

<img align="right" src="docs/Icon.png" width="50px">
GeoReVi (Geological Reservoir Virtualization) is an open-source data management and analysis tool for subsurface characterization. Data is stored in a local or server database dependent on the specific needs. The software runs on all Windows systems.

## Getting started
To get started with GeoReVi you have to download the packed file [GeoReVi.zip](https://github.com/ApirsAL/GeoReVi/blob/master/binaries/GeoReVi.zip) in the **binaries** folder, unpack it and run the installation file (GeoReVi.exe). Tutorials can be found in the user manual. Exemplary datasets and samples are provided in the **docs** folders and in the zip archive. To setup a multi-user-environment you have to change the section including the connection string in your GeoReVi.exe.config file in the installation folder to the according database. However, then a properly structured database with many stored procedures is needed. Contact us under contact@georevi.com for more information.


## The Scope
* Multi-tiered, extendable software application that aims to support geoscientists in common workflows during subsurface characterization
* Geoscientific data management and analysis including petrophysical, geochemical, hydraulic, granulometric, magnetic, mechanical, sedimentary, elastic and radiogenic properties eased by a graphical user interface
* Providing a rich selection of data mining algorithms and visualization techniques specifically aimed to characterize subsurface regions
